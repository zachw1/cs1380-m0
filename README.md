# distribution

This is the distribution library. 

## Environment Setup

We recommend using the prepared [container image](https://github.com/brown-cs1380/container).

## Installation

After you have setup your environment, you can start using the distribution library.
When loaded, distribution introduces functionality supporting the distributed execution of programs. To download it:

```sh
$ npm i '@brown-ds/distribution'
```

This command downloads and installs the distribution library.

## Testing

There are several categories of tests:
  *	Regular Tests (`*.test.js`)
  *	Scenario Tests (`*.scenario.js`)
  *	Extra Credit Tests (`*.extra.test.js`)
  * Student Tests (`*.student.test.js`) - inside `test/test-student`

### Running Tests

By default, all regular tests are run. Use the options below to run different sets of tests:

1. Run all regular tests (default): `$ npm test` or `$ npm test -- -t`
2. Run scenario tests: `$ npm test -- -c` 
3. Run extra credit tests: `$ npm test -- -ec`
4. Run the `non-distribution` tests: `$ npm test -- -nd`
5. Combine options: `$ npm test -- -c -ec -nd -t`

## Usage

To try out the distribution library inside an interactive Node.js session, run:

```sh
$ node
```

Then, load the distribution library:

```js
> let distribution = require("@brown-ds/distribution")();
> distribution.node.start(console.log);
```

Now you have access to the full distribution library. You can start off by serializing some values. 

```js
> s = distribution.util.serialize(1); // '{"type":"number","value":"1"}'
> n = distribution.util.deserialize(s); // 1
```

You can inspect information about the current node (for example its `sid`) by running:

```js
> distribution.local.status.get('sid', console.log); // null 8cf1b (null here is the error value; meaning there is no error)
```

You can also store and retrieve values from the local memory:

```js
> distribution.local.mem.put({name: 'nikos'}, 'key', console.log); // null {name: 'nikos'} (again, null is the error value) 
> distribution.local.mem.get('key', console.log); // null {name: 'nikos'}

> distribution.local.mem.get('wrong-key', console.log); // Error('Key not found') undefined
```

You can also spawn a new node:

```js
> node = { ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 8080 };
> distribution.local.status.spawn(node, console.log);
```

Using the `distribution.all` set of services will allow you to act 
on the full set of nodes created as if they were a single one.

```js
> distribution.all.status.get('sid', console.log); // {} { '8cf1b': '8cf1b', '8cf1c': '8cf1c' } (now, errors are per-node and form an object)
```

You can also send messages to other nodes:

```js
> distribution.local.comm.send(['sid'], {node: node, service: 'status', method: 'get'}, console.log); // null 8cf1c
```

Most methods in the distribution library are asynchronous and take a callback as their last argument.
This callback is called when the method completes, with the first argument being an error (if any) and the second argument being the result.
If you wanted to run this same sequence of commands in a script, you could do something like this (note the nested callbacks):

```js
let distribution = require("@brown-ds/distribution")();
// Now we're only doing a few of the things we did above
const out = (cb) => {
  distribution.local.status.stop(cb); // Shut down the local node
};
distribution.node.start(() => {
  // This will run only after the node has started
  const node = {ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 8765};
  distribution.local.status.spawn(node, (e, v) => {
    if (e) {
      return out(console.log);
    }
    // This will run only after the new node has been spawned
    distribution.all.status.get('sid', (e, v) => {
      // This will run only after we communicated with all nodes and got their sids
      console.log(v); // { '8cf1b': '8cf1b', '8cf1c': '8cf1c' }
      // Shut down the remote node
      distribution.local.comm.send([], {service: 'status', method: 'stop', node: node}, () => {
        // Finally, stop the local node
        out(console.log); // null, {ip: '127.0.0.1', port: 1380}
      });
    });
  });
});
```

## Summary

> Summarize your implementation, including the most challenging aspects; remember to update the `report` section of the `package.json` file with the total number of hours it took you to complete M0 (`hours`), the total number of JavaScript lines you added, including tests (`jsloc`), the total number of shell lines you added, including for deployment and testing (`sloc`).



My implementation consists of 6 components addressing T1--8: `stem.js` (word stemming), `getText.js` (HTML to text conversion), `getURLs.js` (URL extraction), `process.sh` (text normalization), `merge.js` (inverted index merging), and `query.js` (search functionality). The most challenging aspect was `merge.js` because it required combining two differently formatted indices, the local and global, while keeping terms sorted and URLs ordered.


## Correctness & Performance Characterization


> Describe how you characterized the correctness and performance of your implementation.


To characterize correctness, we developed 16 tests that test the following cases: stemming accuracy, HTML text extraction, URL extraction, text normalization, index merging and query functionality.


*Performance*: The throughput of various subsystems is described in the `"throughput"` portion of package.json. The characteristics of my development machines are summarized in the `"dev"` portion of package.json.


## Wild Guess

> How many lines of code do you think it will take to build the fully distributed, scalable version of your search engine? Add that number to the `"dloc"` portion of package.json, and justify your answer below.

I would guess around 8000 LOC would be needed to build the fully distributed version: roughly 2k for communication/RPC, 2k for distributed storage, 2k for parallel processing, and another 2k for testing.
